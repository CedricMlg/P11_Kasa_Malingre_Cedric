# Kasa project

First of all I'll explain what this context file is all about. <br />
For a year and two month I've been in a formation from OpenClassrooms to become a `JS` and `React` developper. <br />
In this formation every single project is made with a story that you could encounter during your developper life. <br />
I will use the context file to explain my role in the project and what I was supposed to do. <br />
Every repo with a `PXX_ProjectName_LastName_FirstName` is a repo of a project realised during my formation with OpenClassrooms. <br />
Now that this is said let's talk about the project. <br />

## The project

The Kasa website was coded more than 10 years ago in ASP.NET with a lot of legacy code. Laura, the CTO, has therefore launched a total redesign to move to a full JavaScript stack with NodeJS on the back-end and React on the front-end. Kasa also took the opportunity to order new models from its usual freelance designer. A big project for this year!. <br />

### My role

Kasa recruits you as a freelance front-end developer to develop their new web platform. Kasa has been in the flat rental business for almost 10 years now. With more than 500 ads posted every day, Kasa is one of the leading flat rental companies in France.. <br />

For this project I had to create an app with on a model, a coding guideline and a JSON file, I had to create the app in React make the navigation between the pages and create React compenent to use throughout the app.
